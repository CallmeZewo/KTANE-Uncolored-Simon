Go quadrant by quadrant and aquire the color that results out of the table.
Each quadrant corresponds to its stamp spot in the same direction.
Columns define the quantity of the same tone of gray in one quadrant
and the rows defines the highest aount of gray tones outside your current quadrant.

with that information you can color in the stamp and submit it.
If your answer was incoorrect, wrong colors will reset to black and
you have to try again, otherwise you go over into stamping phase.

In stamping phase your expert will use the colors you just got and
decipher a movement and rotation patter across the 9 pips you can spot in the big grid.
The defuser should input the sequence, careful top get the position and rotation correctly.
each pip is a spot to stamp on, your colors on yourstamp will be copied to  the
surrounding 4 diamonds. the buttons ontpo of the stamp are for your rotations.
once the pattern is complete the entire 4x4 grid should be filled with colors.
Submitting this phase correctly will start the simon says phase.
A strike resets the 4x4 grid and you try again.

In simon says phase you play a game of simon says in each quadrant to solve the module.
each quadrant will have different colors so the rules will change for each one.#
a strike will only give you a new sequence of simon says in your current quadrant.
once each quadrant has been simon saysed, the module will solve.
